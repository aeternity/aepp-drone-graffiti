# Interacting with the smart contract
The purpose of the vue.js frontend and node.js backend is to provide a simple user interface for this smart contract. 
As the smart contract can also be accessed directly we supply this documentation for interested users to ease their interactions.

## How to bid directly on the contract

### 1. Create your artwork
We published a image conversion library that converts any digital image into a drone flyable svg. 
Clone the [Drone Tracer repository](https://github.com/Drone-Graffiti/DroneTracer) and follow its 
example implementation to load and convert your image.
Its important that you note down the `estimatedTime` property of the resulting `dronePaint` object as 
you will need this later. The SVG can be extracted from `dronePaint.svgFile`.

### 2. Upload your File to IPFS

As with good practice the images are not stored in the contract state but rather a reference to the 
file in the IPFS network is provided. You can obtain this reference by hosting your own
 [IPFS node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/install/) or by using one of the many gateways or upload providers.

### 2.1 Verify your bid (optional)

The node-js server provides an API for you to check your bid against. [Read the documentation here.](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-drone-painting/tree/master/node-server/docs/SANITY.md)

### 3. Call the contract

Next you need to call the smart contracts public function `place_bid` with the `auction_slot_id`, your `estimatedTime`, the `IPFS_hash` and 
the `x` and `y` coordinates. The full signature of the function is listed in the reference below. Here an example using 
the [js-sdk](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/)

```
const Ae = require('@aeternity/aepp-sdk').Universal;

const runBid = async () =>  {

    // Create the test-net client to interact with the blockchain
    let client = await Ae({
      url: 'https://sdk-testnet.aepps.com',
      internalUrl: 'https://sdk-testnet.aepps.com',
      keypair: {
        "publicKey": "ak_fUq2NesPXcYZe...",
        "secretKey": "7c6e602a94f30e4e..."
       },
      nativeMode: true,
      networkId: 'ae_uat'
    });

    // Helper function to decode possible errors
    const decodeError = async (e) => {
        console.error(e);
        if (e.rawTx) console.error('decodeError', await client.unpackAndVerify(e.rawTx));
        if (e.returnValue) {
            const decodedError = await client.contractDecodeData('string', e.returnValue).catch(e => console.error(e));
            console.error('decodedError', decodedError);
        }
    };
    
    const contractAddress = 'ct_2P2vEqq3WQz6kzKLJFoqBbm46EMot64WvpP1xpvvANApLWcwnt';

    // Call the contract from the client defined above
    client.contractCall(contractAddress, 'sophia-address', contractAddress, 'place_bid', {
        // auction_slot_id, estimatedTime, ipfs_hash, x, y
        args: `(19, 20, "QmUG21B7wEfCCABvcZpWKF31Aqc8H2fdGBZ4VSAP6vGvQd", 30, 40)`,
        options: { amount: 10000}
    }).catch(decodeError).then(_ => console.log("Bid Successful"));
}

runBid();

```
